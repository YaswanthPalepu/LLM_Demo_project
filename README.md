## 📌 Project Description

**Help Assistant API** is a full-stack intelligent support system designed to streamline IT help desk operations. It integrates a Python-based backend with a React-powered frontend to deliver a responsive and intuitive user experience.

The backend leverages language models to interpret user queries and automate ticket handling, while the frontend provides a clean interface for users to interact with the assistant.

This project simulates a smart help desk assistant capable of managing service requests, incidents, password resets, and ticket statuses—all with natural language understanding and courteous, professional responses.

## 🔁 How It Works

### ✅ Input
Users interact with the assistant via the frontend by typing natural language queries such as:
- “I need help with my printer”
- “Reset my password”
- “Check ticket #12345”

### 🧠 Processing
- The frontend sends the query to the backend API.
- The backend routes the request to `llm_chain.py`, which interprets the intent using a language model.
- Based on the intent, the system performs actions like creating tickets, sending password reset emails, or retrieving ticket statuses.

### 📤 Output
- The assistant responds with a polite, professional message.
- Ticket statuses are tracked and updated during the session.
- Responses are tailored to the user’s query and follow help desk protocols.
